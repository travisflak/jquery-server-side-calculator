## Description

The problem I solved was creating  a server side calculator with buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, and buttons for equals and C (the C  clears inputs for first and second numbers). I passed through objects of the equations that are entered and appended them to the DOM. I used POST to send to the server and a get request to receive that data. I also created a historical record of all the previous math equations on the server and display a list of the on the DOM. The list is updated evrytime a new equation is entered.
