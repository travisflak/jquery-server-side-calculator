## Description

The problem I solved was creating  a server side calculator with buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, and buttons for equals and C (the C  clears inputs for first and second numbers). I passed through objects of the equations that are entered and appended them to the DOM. I used POST to send to the server and a get request to receive that data. I also created a historical record of all the previous math equations on the server and display a list of the on the DOM. The list is updated evrytime a new equation is entered.

## Installation

- Create a database named your database name,
- The queries in the tables.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly.
- The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. 
- We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries,
- Open up your editor of choice and run an npm install
- Run npm run server in your terminal
- Run npm run client in your terminal
- The npm run client command will open up a new browser tab for you!
